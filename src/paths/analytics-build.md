# Analytics Dashboard Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document provides details about the implementation of the Analytics Dashboard feature in the property management application. The analytics dashboard provides landlords with visualizations and metrics to track the performance of their property portfolios.

## Files Changed
1. `src/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Main analytics dashboard page

## Implementation Details

### Data Fetching
The analytics dashboard utilizes the following functions from `src/lib/firebase/firestoreUtils.ts` to fetch data from Firebase:

- `getAllRentalInventory()` - Retrieves all rental units in the portfolio
- `getAllLeases()` - Retrieves all leases (historical and current)
- `getAllActiveLeases()` - Retrieves only currently active leases
- `getAllRentPayments()` - Retrieves rent payment history

### Key Metrics Calculated

1. **Occupancy Rate**
   - Calculated as the percentage of total units that have active leases
   - Formula: `(number of units with active leases / total number of units in rental inventory) * 100`

2. **Monthly Revenue**
   - Sum of rent amounts from all active leases
   - Formula: `activeLeases.reduce((sum, lease) => sum + lease.rentAmount, 0)`

3. **Foregone Rent**
   - Potential rent lost due to vacant units
   - For each vacant unit, we find the most recent lease or use the default rent amount

4. **Collection Rate**
   - Percentage of expected rent that was actually collected
   - Formula: `(collectedRent / expectedRent) * 100`

### Chart Visualizations

1. **Occupancy Trends**
   - Line chart showing occupancy rate over time
   - Green represents the percentage of units occupied 
   - Data is generated for the selected time period (3 months, 6 months, 1 year, or all time)

2. **Rent Collection**
   - Line chart showing:
     - Collected rent (green line)
     - Foregone rent due to vacancies (red line)
   - Visualizes monthly financial performance

### Monthly Performance Table
The dashboard includes a detailed table showing monthly performance data:
- Month
- Occupied Units
- Vacant Units
- Occupancy Rate (with visual indicator)
- Expected Rent
- Collected Rent
- Collection Rate (with color-coded visual indicator)

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
- **date-fns** - For date manipulation and formatting
- **recharts** - For creating responsive charts
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling the UI components

### Data Processing Logic
1. Data is fetched from Firebase using the utility functions
2. Metrics are calculated based on the fetched data
3. Historical data is generated by analyzing leases and payments for each month in the selected time range
4. Chart data is prepared in the format required by the Recharts library

## Future Enhancements
1. Add filtering options to view analytics for specific properties
2. Implement export functionality to download reports as PDF or Excel
3. Add additional charts for deeper analysis (e.g., tenant turnover, maintenance costs)
4. Implement year-over-year comparisons

## Recent Fixes (Iteration 2)

In the latest update, the following issues were addressed:

### Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed Occupancy Rate Calculation**: 
   - The occupancy rate was incorrectly showing 0% despite having occupied units
   - Fixed by directly using the count of unique occupied unit IDs when calculating the percentage
   - Added safeguards to prevent calculation errors and ensure consistent values

2. **Fixed NaN% Collection Rate Issue**:
   - Added proper handling when the expected rent is zero
   - Implemented logic to show 100% collection when rent is collected but none was expected
   - Added default of 0% when neither collected nor expected rent exists

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added fallback display values for all metrics when data is unavailable
   - Added Number.isNaN checks to prevent displaying "NaN%" in the UI 
   - Added conditional messaging ("No Data", "No Revenue") instead of showing zeros

### Chart Improvements
1. **Simplified Occupancy Chart**:
   - Changed from stacked bar chart to a simple line chart showing only occupancy rate
   - Improved Y-axis to show consistent percentage range (0-100%)
   - Enhanced data point visibility with larger dots and hover effects

2. **Simplified Rent Collection Chart**:
   - Changed from combination chart to a focused line chart with only collected and foregone rent
   - Removed expected rent bars to reduce visual complexity
   - Improved tooltips to show currency values properly formatted

These changes create a more accurate, reliable, and visually appealing analytics dashboard that handles edge cases properly.

## Recent Fixes (Iteration 3)

In this update, the following key issue was addressed:

### Corrected Occupancy Rate Calculation
1. **Fixed Core Calculation Formula**:
   - Updated the occupancy rate calculation to strictly follow the defined formula:
     `Occupancy Rate = (Number of units with active leases / Total number of units in rental inventory) * 100`
   - Ensured consistent use of this formula in both the main metrics and the historical charts
   - Directly used the rental inventory length for the total unit count rather than relying on state variables that might not have updated

2. **Improved Historical Data Accuracy**:
   - For each month's historical data, now correctly identifying units with active leases during that period
   - Applied the same formula consistently to ensure trend data matches current calculations
   - Used a consistent total unit count across all time periods for accurate percentage comparisons

## Issue 1: Light and Dark Mode Inconsistencies [Complete]

### Problem Description
- Inconsistent styling: half the form fields are in light mode while the other half are in dark mode.
- The toggle button for switching between light and dark mode is missing.
- Some headings (e.g., "Recent Activity" on the dashboard) are white when they should be dark.
- Form inputs are rendered with white text on a white background.

### Goals
- Remove the dark mode feature entirely and enforce a uniform light mode (light background with dark text) across the entire application.
- Ensure all headings, form fields, and text elements display consistently in light mode.

### Detailed Roadmap & Guard Rails
1. **Audit & Identify**:
   - Scan all UI components for any conditional styling logic (e.g., dark mode toggles, Tailwind dark mode classes).
   - Document components where dark mode logic is applied.
2. **Solution Iteration**:
   - **Option 1**: Completely remove dark mode toggle logic and any conditional rendering based on theme.
   - **Option 2**: Override dark mode classes by setting Tailwind configuration to disable dark mode (set `darkMode: false`).
   - **Option 3**: Manually refactor each component to enforce a single light mode theme.
   - **Option 4**: Use a global CSS reset that forces a light mode style.
   - **Option 5**: Replace all dark mode specific styles with explicit light mode styles.
3. **Selected Approach**:  
   - Choose **Option 1** (removing all dark mode logic) combined with **Option 2** (updating Tailwind configuration) to minimize complexity.
4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Remove Toggle**: Locate and remove the dark mode toggle button from navigation/header components.
   - **Refactor Components**: 
     - Remove any conditional checks that apply dark mode classes.
     - Update all form inputs, headings, and text components to use classes for dark text on a light background.
   - **Tailwind Configuration**:
     - In `tailwind.config.js`, set `darkMode: false` to disable dark mode entirely.
   - **Testing & Validation**:
     - Test all pages to verify that every element (form fields, headings, buttons) now strictly adheres to the light mode design.
   - **Error Logging**:
     - Add console warnings in key UI components to catch any inadvertent dark mode styling that might have been missed.
5. **Outcome**:
   - All pages must display a consistent light theme.
   - No residual dark mode styles or toggles remain in the code.

**After completing these steps and thorough testing, update this section header to `[Complete]`.**

## Issue 2: Combine Tenants and Leases Functionality [Complete]

### Problem Description
- Redundant and repetitive functionality exists between the separate Tenants and Leases tabs.
- Both tabs use similar forms and data presentation.

### Goals
- Merge the Tenants and Leases features into a single "Tenants" tab.
- Display all tenant information along with lease details in one unified, searchable, tabular view.
- Include an "Add Tenant" button at the top that opens a single, comprehensive form.
- Ensure that file uploads create a dedicated folder on Google Drive named after the lease unit number and tenant name.
- Use the unified Firebase data to feed all analytics dashboards (e.g., number of leases, vacancy reports, drop-downs for emails and WhatsApp).

### Detailed Roadmap & Guard Rails
1. **Audit & Document** [Complete]:
   - Review current code for both Tenants and Leases functionality.
   - List common fields and identify redundancies.
2. **Solution Iteration** [Complete]:
   - Merge the two forms into one unified form that handles both tenant and lease data.

3. **Selected Approach** [Complete]:
   - Merge the forms and data views into one unified "Tenants" tab for simplicity and maintainability.
4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **UI Consolidation** [Complete]:
     - Remove the separate Leases tab.
     - Create a new "Tenants" tab that includes:
       - A searchable, filterable table displaying tenant details and lease history.
       - A search bar with drop-down suggestions (powered by Firebase queries).
       - An "Add Tenant" button at the top that directs to the unified tenant form.
   - **Unified Form** [Complete]:
     - Merge the forms ensuring all fields (tenant and lease details) are present.
     - On form submission:
       - Validate and update the Firebase database.
       - Process file uploads to Google Drive by creating a new folder named using the lease unit number and tenant name.
   - **Analytics Integration** [Complete]:
     - Ensure that the unified data structure populates analytics dashboards for leases, vacancy reports, and messaging targets.
   - **Error Logging** [Complete]:
     - Implement comprehensive try/catch blocks around data submission and file upload processes.
     - Log errors with precise code line references and context to aid troubleshooting.
5. **Outcome** [Complete]:
   - A single "Tenants" tab that replaces redundant functionality.
   - Consistent data entry, display, and analytics across the platform.

**After completing these steps and thorough testing, update this section header to `[Complete]`.**

## Issue 3: Tenant Addition Timeout Issue [Complete]

### Problem Description
- Submitting the tenant addition form results in an indefinite "Saving" state.
- Uncertainty exists on whether the problem is with Firebase connectivity, the API routes, or data processing logic.

### Goals
- Diagnose and resolve the cause of the form submission hang.
- Ensure that the form submission completes and provides appropriate user feedback.

### Detailed Roadmap & Guard Rails
1. **Diagnosis** [Complete]:
   - Check Firebase configuration, network requests, and API routes.
   - Inspect form submission logic for any blocking code or unresolved promises.
2. **Solution Iteration** [Complete]:
   - **Option 1**: Enhance error logging at each stage of form submission to identify the exact failure point.
   - **Option 2**: Refactor the submission function to isolate Firebase write operations, wrapping them in try/catch blocks.
   - **Option 3**: Introduce a timeout mechanism that cancels long-running requests and returns an error.
   - **Option 4**: Test Firebase API endpoints independently using dummy data to confirm connectivity.
3. **Selected Approach** [Complete]:
   - Choose a combination of all above options: Insert detailed error logging and refactor the form submission to isolate and catch Firebase operations. Introduce a timeout mechanism that cancels long-running requests (more than 30 seconds) and returns an error. Also create a script that tests the FIREBASE API endpoints independently using dummy data to confirm connectivity. 
4. **Implementation Steps** [Complete]:
   - **Code Refactoring** [Complete]:
     - Wrap the form submission logic in try/catch blocks.
     - Separate the Firebase write operation into its own function and log the start, success, and failure (with specific line numbers).
   - **Logging Enhancements** [Complete]:
     - Use a logging library or custom logger to capture detailed error messages.
     - Log network requests and responses to isolate whether the issue is in Firebase or routing.
   - **Timeout Handling** [Complete]:
     - Implement a timeout fallback for Firebase operations. If a request exceeds a set time, cancel the operation and notify the user.
   - **Testing & Validation** [Complete]:
     - Test form submission under various conditions (slow network, invalid input) and confirm that errors are logged and handled gracefully.
5. **Outcome** [Complete]:
   - The tenant addition form submits successfully or gracefully times out with an error message.
   - Detailed logs are available to pinpoint any issues during the process.
   - Create a script that tests the FIREBASE API endpoints independently using dummy data to confirm connectivity.
   - Ensure that the form submission is handled properly and the functionality works as required. 

**After completing these steps and thorough testing, update this section header to `[Complete]`.**
